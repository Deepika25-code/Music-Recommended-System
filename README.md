# Music-Recommended-System
The Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System is an innovative real-time application that combines computer vision, deep learning, and personalized music recommendation. It uses live webcam input to detect a user's facial emotion and then suggests a list of songs that align with that emotion, tailored further by language and singer preferences â€” all seamlessly integrated with Spotify.

This project reimagines how machines understand and respond to human feelings through intelligent, emotion-aware user experiences.
